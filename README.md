# eco-kg embeddings

This workspace contains Jupyter notebooks exploring creating node2vec embeddings for the eco-kg graph dataset.

## Quickstart

Create and activate a [python virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), then install the required packages into it using this command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once all the dependencies have been installed, you can run a Jupyter Lab server using this command:

```
./run_jupyter.sh
```

A browser should open displaying the Jupyter Lab UI, with the root directory set to `./notebooks`.

## Data

The eco-kg graph archive is currently hosted here: https://storage.googleapis.com/ecokg/merged-kg.tar.gz.
The archive contains two files, `merged-kg_nodes.tsv` and `merged-kg_edges.tsv`, describing the nodes
and edges of the graph, respectively.

The notebooks will automatically download this file and extract its contents to `./notebooks/data`.

The embeddings generated by `embiggen_ecokg_colab.ipynb` on Oct 22nd (commit 24cb91a6c7f81f6421af9d376cdc94287503a7e5) can be found here:

## Notebooks

There are currently two notebooks:
- **embiggen_ecokg:** an attempt to run ecokg locally, abandoned in favor of the Colab version
- **embiggen_ecokg_colab:** a successful attempt at creating the embeddings, run via Colab Pro.

## About Colab

Google Colab is a free service that Google provides for running notebooks on their infrastructure,
including access to GPUs and TPUs. Colab Pro is a paid service ($9/month at time of writing) that
provides more reliable access to higher-performance machines and a few other perks.

More info about Colab (and Pro) can be found here: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index).
